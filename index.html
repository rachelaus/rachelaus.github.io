        <p> i care a lot about the implications of technology on society! i'm a rising junior at harvard college. i study internet communities and media ecosystems via folklore studies. </p>
        
         <p> some work i have done in my classes:</p>
         <ul class="list"> 
          <li> in a data science class I wondered whether readers would get balanced coverage about different democratic presidential candidates if they were to mainly read one mainstream liberal-leaning news source due to subscription fees. I used R to <a href = "https://rachel-auslander.shinyapps.io/news_and_candidates/"> investigate</a> this by comparing the content and frequency of headlines about different Democratic presidential candidates, and examining the composition of the readership of different news mediums and outlets. </li>
          <li> in my final project for Fixing Social Media, i <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OipEZtTmDFs6aOriA005MyJKKOf4Y_ia/view"> researched</a> why comment sections tend to be toxic spaces and designed a comment plug-in to contextualize discussions and promote healthier discourse. my teammate and I interviewed journalists and New York Times comment moderators, researched current comment spaces online, and wrote a design brief.</li>
          <li> i wrote a <a href = "https://fixingsocialmedia.mit.edu/2020/05/13/online-community-case-study-rookie/"> case study</a> on Rookie Magazine and examined what made it a healthy online community.
